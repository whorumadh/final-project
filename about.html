            <h2>What Is Dungeons & Dragons?</h2>
            <p>Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is the original tabletop role-playing game, where you and your friends tell a shared story, solve challenges, and battle monsters using imagination, dice, and character abilities.</p>

            <h3>Origins</h3>
            <p>Created in 1974 by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, D&D evolved from medieval wargaming into a rich fantasy experience that has inspired video games, novels, and millions of players worldwide.</p>

            <h3>How to Play</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Character Creation:</strong> Choose a race, class, background, and roll your ability scores.</li>
                <li><strong>Role-Play & Exploration:</strong> Describe what your character does, interact with NPCs, and explore dungeons.</li>
                <li><strong>Combat & Dice Rolls:</strong> When you take actions—attack, cast spells, pick locks—you roll a d20 and add modifiers to determine success or failure.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="about-section">
            <h3>Gameplay Basics</h3>
            <p>D&D sessions are led by a Dungeon Master (DM) who narrates the world and controls NPCs. Players describe their actions, roll dice to resolve challenges, and collaborate to overcome obstacles.</p>
            <p>The core mechanic revolves around rolling a 20-sided die (d20), adding relevant modifiers, and comparing the result against a target Difficulty Class (DC) to determine success or failure.</p>
